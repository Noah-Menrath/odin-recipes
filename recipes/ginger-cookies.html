        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cookies are absolutely <em>tasty!</em> They are very easy to make and do not take much time at all!
            They are very soft and have a nice but not too overbearing ginger taste. The cinnamon adds
            a nice spice of life in these little bunches of joy.
