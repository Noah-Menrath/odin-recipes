                <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
                <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cake-sub"><h4>Cheesecake</h4></div>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (8 ounce) packages Cream Cheese, room temperature (32- ounces in total)</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream, room temperature</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
                <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="cake-heading"><h2>Steps:</h2></div>
            <div class="cake-sub"><h4>Make the crust</h4></div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Double wrap the bottom of the springform pan with foil, sealing it tightly to prevent water from getting into the pan.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl mix the graham cracker crumbs, butter, granulated sugar, and salt together evenly.</li>
                    <li>Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of 9-inch springform pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes, or until lightly golden. Set aside while you make the cheesecake filling.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="cake-sub"><h4>Make the Cheesecake</h4></div>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed, until smooth, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary.</li>
                    <li>Turn the mixer to low and add the sour cream and vanilla; mix well, scraping sides of the bowl as necessary.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until mixed. Don’t over mix.</li>
                    <li>Pour the filling over crust and spread evenly.</li>
                    <li>Place the springform pan into a larger pan and pour very hot water into the pan, until it’s 3/4- inch deep, careful to make sure the water level doesn’t come up higher than the foil.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 60-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. The center will still jiggle while the edges will be set.</li>
                    <li>Carefully run a knife around the rim of pan to loosen cake.</li>
                    <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for at least an hour, then cover and transfer into the refrigerator for 6 hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Release the sides of the springform pan before slicing.</li>
                </ol>
