            <p>This is an amazing tasting smoothie! It only has the essentials, it has no added unneeded Ingridents
            such as sugar, milk, etc. The combination of the strawberries, blueberries, and banana gives it
            a very sweet taste with an explosion of the mix of fruit flavors. This is a smoothie to try.
